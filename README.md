**IP over Tin Can and String** (IPoTCaS, pronounced "eye-poh-tee-kass"),
also known as EtherKnit or "what is this annoying buzzing noise",
is a revolutionary new way to connect to the internet over a fiber connection.

Using only two pieces of string and lots of annoying sounds,
IPoTCas can create a **6.9 kbps** connection capable of browsing the web,
downloading files, and giving you a newfound distaste for web bloat.

More description coming soon!

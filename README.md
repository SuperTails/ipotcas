**IP over Tin Can and String** (IPoTCaS, pronounced "eye-poh-tee-kass"),
also known as EtherKnit or "what is this annoying buzzing noise",
is a revolutionary new way to connect to the internet over a fiber connection.

Using only two pieces of string and lots of annoying sounds,
IPoTCaS can create a **6.9 kbps** connection capable of browsing the web,
downloading files, and giving you a newfound distaste for web bloat.

# Physical Setup

The linear rails are sourced from two listings on Amazon,
but I'd highly recommend just using the first one because the wider rails are much worse
(though the CAD will require some modification):
- [Small rails](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54LDBHN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- [Large rails](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088B6XN2J?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)

Any generic Kevlar kite string will probably work,
but I used specifically
[this amazon listing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088PT4KKG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
from `emma kites`.

The mount CAD is available on
[Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/322e68c2d75961563174bd8a/w/bb42fd02dcb60f17fdcb0973/e/e357883cf5ed7cb39072be44?renderMode=0&uiState=687ea4469b7eec1ebb9bbd03).
I have not tested with materials other than PLA.
The model is designed to work with metric heat-set inserts to hold down the rails.

# Modulation

IPoTCaS uses 32-QAM and 12-carrier OFDM between 7 and 14 kHz.
